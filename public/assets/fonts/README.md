# Certificate Fonts

Place the following font files in this directory:

1. **AlexBrush-Regular.ttf** - Used for the student name on the certificate
2. **COLTONSC.ttf** - Used for certificate ID and date

The fonts will be automatically registered when the certificate generation API is called.

If fonts are not found, the system will fall back to Arial font.
