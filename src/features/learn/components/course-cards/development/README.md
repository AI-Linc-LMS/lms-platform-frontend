# Development Environment for LMS Platform

## Overview
This directory contains two implementations of the code editor for the Development tab in the LMS platform:

1. `DevelopmentCard.tsx` - Using Monaco Editor
2. `CodeMirrorDevelopmentCard.tsx` - Using CodeMirror (recommended)

Both implementations provide similar functionality, but the CodeMirror version offers better performance and simplicity.

## Features

- Tabbed editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Live preview in an embedded iframe
- Preview in a new tab option
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Code hints for assignments
- Error handling
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S to submit, Ctrl+P to preview)
- Responsive design

## Usage

The CourseTopicDetailPage component uses the CodeMirrorDevelopmentCard by default. If you prefer to use the Monaco Editor implementation, you can import and use DevelopmentCard instead.

## Dependencies

### Monaco Editor Implementation
- @monaco-editor/react

### CodeMirror Implementation
- @uiw/react-codemirror
- @codemirror/lang-html
- @codemirror/lang-css
- @codemirror/lang-javascript
- @codemirror/theme-one-dark

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the editor:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Check for //console errors in the browser
3. Try clearing the browser cache
4. If using the monaco editor and experiencing performance issues, try switching to the CodeMirror implementation

## Contributing

When making changes to the editor, make sure to test across different browsers and screen sizes.
