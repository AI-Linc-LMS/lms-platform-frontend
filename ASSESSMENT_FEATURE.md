# Assessment Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the new assessment feature for the LMS platform. The feature allows users to take a pre-assessment to determine their skill level and eligibility for scholarships.

## Feature Flow
1. **Entry Point**: Users see an assessment banner on the "Our Courses" page
2. **Pre-Assessment Page**: Users are presented with information about the assessment
3. **Assessment Quiz**: Users take a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions
4. **Results**: Users receive their score and are redirected back to the courses page with a success notification

## Components Created

### 1. AssessmentBanner (`src/features/learn/components/assessment/AssessmentBanner.tsx`)
- Displays a prominent banner on the courses page
- Matches the design from the provided mockup
- Includes call-to-action button to start the assessment
- Features gradient background and decorative elements

### 2. Assessment (`src/features/learn/pages/Assessment.tsx`)
- Pre-assessment landing page
- Explains the purpose and duration of the assessment
- Provides a "Start Assessment" button to begin the quiz
- Clean, centered design with assessment icon

### 3. ShortAssessment (`src/features/learn/pages/ShortAssessment.tsx`)
- Main assessment quiz interface
- Reuses existing quiz UI patterns from the codebase
- Features:
  - Question navigation sidebar
  - Timer functionality (5 minutes)
  - Multiple choice questions with A, B, C, D options
  - Progress tracking
  - Completion validation
  - Results calculation

### 4. AssessmentSuccessNotification (`src/features/learn/components/assessment/AssessmentSuccessNotification.tsx`)
- Toast notification shown after assessment completion
- Displays score and performance metrics
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Color-coded based on performance (green/yellow/red)

## Routes Added
- `/assessment` - Pre-assessment landing page
- `/assessment/quiz` - The actual assessment quiz

## Integration Points

### Courses Page Updates
- Added AssessmentBanner component
- Added success notification handling
- Integrated with React Router location state for result display

### Routes Configuration
- Added new routes to `src/routes.ts`
- Both routes require authentication (`isPrivate: true`)

## Mock Data
The assessment currently uses mock questions about machine learning topics. In a production environment, these would be fetched from an API.

Sample questions include:
- Basic machine learning concepts
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Model evaluation metrics
- Overfitting concepts

## Styling
- Uses existing design system colors and patterns
- Consistent with the existing quiz components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Future Enhancements
1. **API Integration**: Replace mock data with real API calls
2. **Question Bank**: Implement dynamic question selection
3. **Difficulty Levels**: Add adaptive questioning based on performance
4. **Results Storage**: Save assessment results to user profile
5. **Scholarship Calculation**: Implement actual scholarship eligibility logic
6. **Analytics**: Track assessment completion rates and performance

## Testing
The feature can be tested by:
1. Navigating to the courses page (`/courses`)
2. Clicking "Take an Assessment" on the banner
3. Clicking "Start Assessment" on the pre-assessment page
4. Completing the 6-question quiz
5. Observing the success notification upon completion

## Dependencies
- React Router for navigation
- Existing quiz UI components for consistency
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
