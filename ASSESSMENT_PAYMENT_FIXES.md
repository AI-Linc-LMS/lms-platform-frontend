# Assessment Payment System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Amount Correction
- **Before**: Payment was set to ₹49 (4900 paise)
- **After**: Payment is now set to ₹25 (2500 paise) as required by backend
- **Files Modified**: `src/features/learn/pages/InstructionPage.tsx`

### 2. Dynamic Assessment ID Support
- **Before**: Assessment ID was hardcoded to "ai-linc-scholarship-test" throughout the application
- **After**: Assessment ID is now dynamic and can be passed via URL parameters
- **New Route**: `/assessment/:assessmentId` - supports any assessment ID
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old route `/ai-linc-scholarship-test` still works
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/routes.ts`
  - `src/features/learn/pages/InstructionPage.tsx`
  - `src/features/learn/pages/ShortAssessment.tsx`
  - `src/features/learn/pages/PhoneVerificationPage.tsx`
  - `src/features/learn/hooks/useAssessment.ts`
  - `src/features/learn/components/assessment/AssessmentHeader.tsx`
  - `src/features/learn/components/assessment/AssessmentBanner.tsx`

### 3. User and Assessment Specific Payment Storage
- **Before**: Payment status was stored globally, causing issues across different users and assessments
- **After**: Payment status is now stored with keys specific to both user (clientId) and assessment ID
- **Storage Key Format**: `assessment_payment_${clientId}_${assessmentId}`
- **Files Modified**: `src/features/learn/pages/InstructionPage.tsx`

### 4. Correct Payment Payload Format
- **Before**: Payment API calls were missing required fields for assessment payments
- **After**: Payment API now sends correct payload format:
  ```json
  {
    "amount": "2500",
    "payment_type": "ASSESSMENT", 
    "type_id": "assessment-id"
  }
  ```
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/services/payment/paymentGatewayApis.ts`
  - `src/services/payment/razorpayService.ts`

### 5. Enhanced Navigation Flow
- **Before**: Navigation between assessment pages was hardcoded
- **After**: Navigation now properly passes assessment ID through route state and URL parameters
- **Flow**: Instruction Page → Phone Verification → Quiz → Results
- **Files Modified**: Multiple component files to support state passing

## Usage Examples

### Access Different Assessments
- Default assessment: `/ai-linc-scholarship-test` (backward compatible)
- Custom assessment: `/assessment/my-custom-assessment-id`
- Quiz with specific assessment: `/assessment/quiz` (gets ID from state/params)

### Payment Flow
1. User visits assessment instruction page
2. Clicks "Pay ₹25 & Start Test"
3. Payment gateway receives correct payload with assessment ID
4. On successful payment, user proceeds to phone verification
5. After phone verification, user starts the quiz
6. Payment status is stored per user per assessment

### Assessment ID Propagation
- URL Parameters: `/assessment/:assessmentId`
- Route State: `navigate("/path", { state: { assessmentId } })`
- Component Props: Components accept assessmentId as props
- Fallback: Always falls back to "ai-linc-scholarship-test" if no ID provided

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Visit `/assessment/test-assessment-id` 
2. Complete payment flow
3. Verify payment is specific to that assessment ID
4. Try with different assessment IDs to ensure isolation
5. Test backward compatibility with `/ai-linc-scholarship-test`

## Backend Requirements Met
- ✅ Amount: "2500" (₹25 in paise)
- ✅ Payment Type: "ASSESSMENT"
- ✅ Type ID: Assessment ID from URL/state
- ✅ User-specific payment tracking
- ✅ Assessment-specific payment tracking
