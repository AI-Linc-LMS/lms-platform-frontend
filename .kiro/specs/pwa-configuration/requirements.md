# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) by adding the necessary configuration, service worker, and manifest files. The PWA implementation will enable users to install the app on their devices, work offline with cached content, and receive push notifications while maintaining all existing functionality without disruption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the web application on my device like a native app, so that I can access it quickly from my home screen without opening a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application THEN the browser SHALL display an install prompt for the PWA
2. WHEN the user clicks install THEN the application SHALL be added to their device's home screen or app drawer
3. WHEN the user opens the installed PWA THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. WHEN the PWA is installed THEN it SHALL have a proper app icon and name displayed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work offline or with poor connectivity, so that I can continue using basic features even when my internet connection is unstable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loses internet connection THEN the application SHALL continue to display previously cached content
2. WHEN the user navigates to cached pages offline THEN the application SHALL load them without error
3. WHEN the user tries to access uncached content offline THEN the application SHALL display a meaningful offline message
4. WHEN the user regains internet connection THEN the application SHALL automatically sync and update content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly on subsequent visits, so that I have a smooth and responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application for the second time THEN critical resources SHALL be served from cache
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display content faster than the initial uncached load
3. WHEN new updates are available THEN the service worker SHALL update the cache in the background
4. WHEN cache updates are complete THEN the user SHALL be notified of available updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PWA implementation to not interfere with existing functionality, so that all current features continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is implemented THEN all existing routes SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN the PWA is implemented THEN all API calls SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN the PWA is implemented THEN all existing user interactions SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN the PWA is implemented THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PWA to meet modern web standards, so that it provides a reliable and secure experience across different devices and browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is audited THEN it SHALL score above 90 on Lighthouse PWA metrics
2. WHEN the PWA is accessed THEN it SHALL work on HTTPS connections
3. WHEN the PWA is tested THEN it SHALL be responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
4. WHEN the PWA manifest is validated THEN it SHALL meet W3C PWA specification requirements
